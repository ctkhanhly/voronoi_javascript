        The goal of this project is to demonstrate how beachline data structure changes during Fortune's algorithm and emphasizes
        the following lemmas taken from Computational Geometry book by:
        <ul>
            <li> 
                The only way in which a new arc can appear on the beach line is through a site event
            </li>
            <li>
                The only way in which an existing arc can disappear from the beach line is through a circle event
            </li>
            <li>
                Breakpoints on the beach line trace out the Voronoi Diagram
            </li>
            <li>
                The Voronoi Diagram is a collection of boundary of points that are closest to each site
            </li>
            <li>
                The vertices of the Voronoi Diagram is the center of three or more sites such that there are no other sites inside this circle
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        
        
        <p>
            There are two main data structures in my implementation. 
            The first data structure is a binary tree in which internal nodes are breakpoints (or intersections of two parabolic arcs), and 
            leaves are the parabolas. Each arc on the beachline comes from a parabola of a site and is defined by two endpoints, which 
            can either be its intersection with the bounding box or with another parabola. Therefore, the endpoints of each arc defines a distinct interval
            and all intervals are continuous and non-overlapping, which together makes up the beachline. Each arc draws the set of points that have 
            an equal distance from the site that the arc is defined and the current sweepline ly. For a given site (px, py) and sweepline
            ly, we obtain the following equation that defines the arc:
        </p>
        

        <div id="katex-parabola-eq">

        </div>
        Thus a parabola consists of
        <ul>
            <li>A Site Coordinate (x,y)</li>
            <li>a,b,c which is not stored explicitly but computed for each event ly and a given site</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I used the idea of <a href="http://blog.ivank.net/fortunes-algorithm-and-implementation.html#impl_cpp">this blog</a> to implement the binary tree. In a site event,
        we need to be able to search a vertical arc that is right above the site, we can do so by searching on the x coordinates of the breakpoints
        to arrive at the appropriate arc on the leaf level. The x coordinate can be computed by solving for the intersection of the two parabolas
        that define this breakpoint, which changes as ly changes since the parabola equation depends on both ly and a site coordinate. Each breakpoint 
        is defined by a parabola on the left and one on the right, and its coordinate can be computed as:
        
        </p>
        
        <div id="katex-breakpoint-eq">

        </div>
        A Breakpoint is consists of:
        <ul>
            <li>A left site that defines the parabola on the left</li>
            <li>A right site that defines the parabola on the right</li>
            <li>An edge that it traces</li>
        </ul>
       
        Each arc(site, a,b,c) on the beachline is defined by a site, a left breakpoint and a right breakpoint. If there is no left breakpoint, the left bound of the arc
        is the intersection of the parabola defined by the site and the bounding box and the case where there is no right breakpoint is defined similarly.
        We will later use the left and right intersection for 3 point Belzier curve to draw the arcs on screen. The start point p1(x1,y1) and end point p3(x3,y3) 
        will be the left and right intersection. We calculate control point p2 as: p2 = ((x1+x3)/2, (x3-x1)/2 * (2a+x1+b) + y1).
        We don't have to store the left and right breakpoint explicitly, since they will just be left and right parent of the arc.

        <p> 

        The second data structure is an Event Queue which is a max binary heap 
        and sorted by highest to lowest y values and smallest to highest x values of two points share the same height. Each Event in the 
        Event Queue can either be a circle event, which would have the attribute cValid to indicate whether this event is still valid 
        (more on this below) and the attribute circle_event, and a site. Each circle event is associated with a disappearabce of a parabolic
        arc, which is also the middle arc in a three-consecutive set of arcs on the beachline. The second type of event is the site event 
        which will introduces a new arc associated with this site and potentially split an existing arc into two arcs. The y coordinate of each
        event defines the new sweepline ly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below is an illustration of a site event where a new site p2 appears.
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="./assets/images/site_event_no_neighbor.png" style="height:30%;width:30%;margin:auto"/>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            When the site just appears, the arc defined by p2 is just a straightline to a vertical arc right above it defined by p1 (arc0). The intersection of arc0
            and the vertical line from p2 defines two breakpoints b1,b2 which originally coincides as illustrated in the picture. 
            As the event line sweeps downward, we will see in the next illustration that b1 and b2 start diverging, and the points where b1 and b2 trace as the event
            line sweeps down defines the two edges that have opposite directions and have the original intersection as the start endpoint of these two edges (blue dot).
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="./assets/images/site_event_split_neighbor.png" style="height:30%;width:30%;margin:auto"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            We will update the tree as the following:
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="./assets/images/tree_site_event_before.png" style="height:10%;width:10%;margin:auto;"/>
            <img src="./assets/images/tree_site_event_after.png" style="height:20%;width:20%;margin:auto;"/>
        </div>

        <p>
            If there was a circle event associated with p1, we will mark this circle event cValid as a false alarm since this circle
            contains p2.
            After adding two new edges and updating the tree, we will check the neighbor arcs (arc4, arc5) if they exist
            for potential circle events defined by (arc4, arc1, arc2), (arc1, arc2, arc5) and add it to the event queue.
            In the implementation followed by the idea of <a href="http://blog.ivank.net/fortunes-algorithm-and-implementation.html#impl_cpp">this blog</a>, 
            I just check for the edge intersection. For example, if I check for circle event in which arc1 is the disappearing arc, I will look for its Left
            breakpoint that is the intersection of (arc4, arc1) and a right breakpoint that is the intersection of (arc1, arc2) and find the intersection 
            of the edges associated with left and right breakpoints. Each edge is defined by a start, an end point, and a line equation: ay + bx + c = 0, adding
            we can compute the intersection as:
            <div id="edge-intersection-eq">

            </div>
            <p>
                This intersection will become the center of the circle event and we add the lowest point of this circle to the event queue (the intersection of the 
                vertical line from the center with the circle).
                Below is an illustration for a circle event.
            </p>
            
            <div>
                <img src="./assets/images/circle_event_unmerged.png" style="height:30%;width:30%;margin:auto;"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                Here we see that the edges traced by b1 and b2 are converging to a circle center.
            </p>
            
            <div>
                <img src="./assets/images/circle_event_merged.png" style="height:30%;width:30%;margin:auto;"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                Here arc 0 is the original parabola defined by p1, arc 7 is the part of the parabola defined by p1 after breakpoint b1.
            Arc 6 disappears at a circle event where b1 and b2 converge to the center of the circle. 
            We will delete the lower breakpoint between b1, b2 (in this case, we remove b2) and the parabola from the tree and modify 
            breakpoint b1 to be the breakpoint of arc_1 and arc_2. We will also add a new edge whose starting point starts from b1.
            <div>
                <img src="./assets/images/tree_site_event_before.png" style="height:10%;width:10%;margin:auto;"/>
                <img src="./assets/images/tree_circle_event1.png" style="height:20%;width:20%;margin:auto;"/>
                <img src="./assets/images/tree_circle_event2.png" style="height:20%;width:20%;margin:auto;"/>
                <img src="./assets/images/tree_circle_event3.png" style="height:20%;width:20%;margin:auto;"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                After removing the parabola, we need to check for two new potential circle events (arc_3, arc_1, arc_2), (arc_1, arc_2, arc_4).
                In general, we have to check for a circle event when there are new three consecutive set of arcs.
            </p>
             Since the implementation does not have a balancing component for the tree data structure, it runs in O(n^2) and the event queue runs in O((m+n)log(n+m)) time.
             where n is the number of sites and m is the number of vertices of the Voronoi Diagram (the circle centers).
