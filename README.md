# voronoi_javascript

Deployed Code is on Branch gh-pages

I used the idea of http://blog.ivank.net/fortunes-algorithm-and-implementation.html#impl_cpp to implement the binary tree data structure to store arcs and beachlines, which runs in O(n^2) since the tree does not have balancing operations. But the solution itself is pretty fast to generate even a few hundred points.
